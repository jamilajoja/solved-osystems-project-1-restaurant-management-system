A fast-food restaurant has a process of a Manager, Cook, Waiter, and Customer. At the start, the restaurant has one manager, cook, waiter and customer but you can create multiple Cooks and Waiters to handle more than one Customer using multithreading. When the customer will place its order you will calculate the total preparation time of all the dishes that the customer ordered and the customer will wait for that time.

Step-1: Customer will tell his name and ID to Manager and can ask him about Menu. Step-2: The manager will give the menu to the customer.Step-3: Customer will check menu and place order.Step-4: The manager will receive an order and keep these orders in the sequence Step-5: The manager will calculate the bill of the customer and add into (Daily_Sales). Step-6: Now any available cook will get the order

Step-7: One order can have multiple dishes therefore multiple cooks can work for the preparation of one order to minimize preparation time.Step-8: Any available waiters will get prepared food and deliver to customers one waiter can deliver one order at a time. After delivery waiter will add order amount in (Daily_Waiter_Sales). Step-9: Customer will get his order give confirmation message and terminate.

Step-10: At the end you have to compare Daily_Waiter_Sales with Daily_Sales and print their values.
